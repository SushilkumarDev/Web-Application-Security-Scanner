# **Security Policy**

## **Supported Versions**

We maintain security support for the following versions of the Web Application Security Scanner:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

Please ensure you are using the latest release to benefit from security updates and patches.

## **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by following these steps:

1. **Contact us directly** at **[sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com]** instead of publicly opening an issue.
2. **Provide a clear description** of the vulnerability, including:
   - **Steps to reproduce the issue**
   - **Potential impact or risk** of the vulnerability
   - Any **mitigations** that might reduce the risk
3. **Allow us adequate time** to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and will provide a detailed response with any steps we plan to take. Public disclosure of the vulnerability is recommended only after a fix has been released.

## **Vulnerability Handling Process**

Our process for handling reported vulnerabilities includes the following steps:

1. **Initial Triage**: Upon receiving a report, we conduct an initial analysis to confirm and prioritize the issue.
2. **Classification and Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact, using CVSS scoring to prioritize the fix.
3. **Patch Development**: A maintainer develops a patch, which is then reviewed and tested thoroughly.
4. **Release and Communication**: Once tested, the patch is integrated into the next release, and contributors are informed. Vulnerability details will be disclosed only after a fix is available.

## **Security Best Practices for Contributors**

To maintain high security standards, contributors should adhere to the following practices when contributing code:

- **Follow Secure Coding Standards**: Familiarize yourself with OWASP guidelines to mitigate common web application vulnerabilities, such as:
  - **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Sanitize user input and validate output.
  - **CSRF**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
- **Validate User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
- **Use Secure Libraries**: Only include libraries from trusted sources and keep dependencies updated.
- **Handle Sensitive Data Carefully**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data such as API keys or passwords.

## **Security Features in Web Application Security Scanner**

The Web Application Security Scanner includes several built-in features to ensure robust security:

- **SSL/TLS Scanning**: Identifies SSL/TLS misconfigurations to prevent data interception.
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: Flags potential XSS risks in user inputs.
- **Authentication Mechanisms**: Ensures secure login handling and session management.
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Provides a report highlighting high-risk vulnerabilities for rapid remediation.

## **Disclosure Policy**

We follow responsible disclosure practices to ensure the security of our users and stakeholders. We will publicly acknowledge the reporter’s contribution if they wish and will keep the vulnerability information private until a patch is released.

**Thank you for helping make Web Application Security Scanner secure for everyone.**
